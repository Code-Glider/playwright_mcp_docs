‚öôÔ∏èExamples of API automation
============================

Lets see how we can use the power of Playwright MCP Server to automate API of our application

### Scenario[‚Äã](https://executeautomation.github.io/mcp-playwright/docs/playwright-api/Examples#scenario "Direct link to Scenario")

`// Basic POST requestPerform POST operation for the URL https://api.restful-api.dev/objects with body{   "name": "Apple MacBook Pro 16",   "data": {      "year": 2024,      "price": 2499,      "CPU model": "M4",      "Hard disk size": "5 TB"   }}And verify if the response has createdAt and id property and store the ID in a variable for future reference say variable productID// POST request with Bearer token authorizationPerform POST operation for the URL https://api.restful-api.dev/objects with Bearer token "your-token-here" set in the headers{        'Content-Type': 'application/json',        'Authorization': 'Bearer your-token-here'      },and body{   "name": "Secure MacBook Pro",   "data": {      "year": 2024,      "price": 2999,      "CPU model": "M4 Pro",      "Hard disk size": "8 TB",      "security": "enhanced"   }}Perform GET operation for the created ProductID using URL https://api.restful-api.dev/objects/productID and verify the response has properties like Id, name, dataPerform PUT operation for the created ProductID using URL https://api.restful-api.dev/objects/productID with body {   "name": "Apple MacBook Pro 16",   "data": {      "year": 2025,      "price": 4099,      "CPU model": "M5",      "Hard disk size": "10 TB",      "color": "Titanium"   }}And verify if the response has createdAt and id propertyPerform PATCH operation for the created ProductID using URL https://api.restful-api.dev/objects/productID with body{   "name": "Apple MacBook Pro 19 (Limited Edition)"}And verify if the response has updatedAt property with value Apple MacBook Pro 19 (Limited Edition)`

And once the entire test operation completes, we will be presented with the entire details of how the automation did happened.

tip

You can also see the `Request/Response/StatusCode` from the execution of Playwright MCP Server
