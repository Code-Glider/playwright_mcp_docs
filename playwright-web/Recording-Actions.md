üé• Recording Actions
====================

Playwright MCP allows you to record your browser interactions and automatically generate test specifications. This feature helps you create automated tests without writing code manually.

Getting Started[‚Äã](https://executeautomation.github.io/mcp-playwright/docs/playwright-web/Recording-Actions#getting-started "Direct link to Getting Started")
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To start recording your actions and generate test files, you'll need to:

1.   Start a recording session
2.   Perform your actions using MCP tools
3.   End the session to generate the test file

### Example[‚Äã](https://executeautomation.github.io/mcp-playwright/docs/playwright-web/Recording-Actions#example "Direct link to Example")

Here's a complete example of recording actions and generating a test spec:

1.   First, start a new recording session by specifying:

    *   Where to save the generated tests (`tests/generated` directory)
    *   What to name your tests (using 'LoginTest' as a prefix)
    *   Whether to include helpful comments in the generated code

2.   Then perform the test actions:

    *   Navigate to the Sauce Demo website ([https://www.saucedemo.com](https://www.saucedemo.com/))
    *   Enter "standard_user" in the username field
    *   Enter "secret_sauce" in the password field
    *   Click the login button

3.   Finally, end the recording session to generate your test file

The generated test file will look something like this:

`import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';test('LoginTest_2024-03-23', async ({ page }) => {  // Navigate to the login page  await page.goto('https://www.saucedemo.com');  // Fill in username  await page.fill('#user-name', 'standard_user');  // Fill in password  await page.fill('#password', 'secret_sauce');  // Click login button  await page.click('#login-button');  // Verify successful login  await expect(page).toHaveURL(/.*inventory.html/);});`

Configuration Options[‚Äã](https://executeautomation.github.io/mcp-playwright/docs/playwright-web/Recording-Actions#configuration-options "Direct link to Configuration Options")
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When starting a recording session, you can configure several options:

*   **outputPath**: Directory where the generated test files will be saved
*   **testNamePrefix**: Prefix for the generated test names
*   **includeComments**: Whether to include descriptive comments in the generated tests

For example, you might configure your session to:

*   Save tests in a 'tests/generated' folder
*   Name tests with a 'MyTest' prefix
*   Include helpful comments in the generated code

Session Management[‚Äã](https://executeautomation.github.io/mcp-playwright/docs/playwright-web/Recording-Actions#session-management "Direct link to Session Management")
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can manage your recording sessions using these tools:

*   **get_codegen_session**: Retrieve information about a recording session
*   **clear_codegen_session**: Clean up a recording session without generating a test

These tools help you check the status of your recording or clean up if you want to start over without generating a test file.

Best Practices[‚Äã](https://executeautomation.github.io/mcp-playwright/docs/playwright-web/Recording-Actions#best-practices "Direct link to Best Practices")
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.   **Organize Tests**: Use meaningful test name prefixes to organize your generated tests
2.   **Clean Up**: Always end or clear your sessions after recording
3.   **Verify Actions**: Include verification steps in your recordings
4.   **Maintain Context**: Keep related actions in the same recording session
5.   **Documentation**: Add comments during recording for better test maintainability

Running Generated Tests[‚Äã](https://executeautomation.github.io/mcp-playwright/docs/playwright-web/Recording-Actions#running-generated-tests "Direct link to Running Generated Tests")
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To run your generated tests, use the Playwright test runner:

`npx playwright test tests/generated/logintest_*.spec.ts`

tip

You can modify the generated test files to add additional assertions, setup, or teardown code as needed.
