üìÅ Support of Console Logs
==========================

Playwright MCP Server now supports Console logging of browsers with the power of Playwright. This feature is especially useful when you want to capture the logs of the browser console while performing any action during development and testing.

Following logs types are supported

*   `log`
*   `info`
*   `warn`
*   `error`
*   `debug`
*   `all`

Usage Example

To invoke `Playwright_console_logs` via MCP Playwright, use the following prompt:

`Get the console log from the browser whenever you perform any action.`
