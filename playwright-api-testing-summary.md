# Playwright MCP Server: No-Code API Testing with AI

This document summarizes the key features and capabilities of the Playwright MCP Server regarding its new API testing support, as demonstrated in the video "End of Postman? No-Code API Testing with Playwright + AI ðŸ§ ðŸ¤–" by Merlin AI.

The Playwright MCP Server extends the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to enable AI assistants like Claude to interact with local systems, including browsers and now, APIs.

**Key Capabilities for API Testing:**

1.  **Natural Language Commands:** Perform API testing operations using plain English text commands.
2.  **Supported HTTP Methods:** Execute standard API requests including:
    *   `POST`
    *   `GET`
    *   `PUT`
    *   `PATCH`
    *   `DELETE`
3.  **Request Customization:** Specify the target URL and request body directly in the command.
4.  **Response Verification:** Verify response properties (e.g., checking for the existence of `createdAt` or `id` properties) and response status codes (e.g., 200, 404, 500).
5.  **Workflow Chaining:** Store data from responses (like an `id`) in variables for use in subsequent API calls, enabling complex test workflows directly via natural language.

**How it Works:**

The Playwright MCP Server, specifically versions 0.2.5 and above, leverages Playwright's API testing capabilities under the hood to execute the requested operations and provide results, including the response body and status code, back to the AI model.

**Getting Started:**

To utilize this feature, ensure you have the Playwright MCP Server (version 0.2.5 or later) installed and configured in your Claude Desktop client. Installation can be done via npm, mcp-get, or Smithery, and configuration involves updating the `claude-desktop-config.json` file to include the Playwright MCP server command.

This capability allows users to perform comprehensive API test workflows using intuitive natural language commands, potentially reducing the reliance on traditional API testing tools for certain scenarios.

**Future Enhancements:**

Future updates are planned to extend support for handling more complex data types, such as images, binary data, and multi-form inputs in API requests.
